# ⚠️ DEPRECATED - This mod does not work reliably

**This repository is archived and the mod is no longer maintained.**

## Why This Mod Doesn't Work

Despite multiple attempts to patch the game's mutation system, NPCs still use Spacetime Vortex inconsistently. The game's internal ability activation system proved too complex to reliably intercept with Harmony patches.

## ✅ Use This Instead: Normality Gas

The **in-game solution** that actually works:

### Normality Gas Grenades
- **Contest activation** of Spacetime Vortex before it takes effect
- **Suppress mental mutations** temporarily
- Available from merchants and as loot

### How to Use
1. Stock up on normality gas grenades
2. When you see an enemy with Spacetime Vortex about to activate, throw the grenade at them
3. The ability activation can be prevented

### Other Counters
- **Distance**: Stay 9+ tiles away to be out of range
- **Confusion**: Flashbangs and confusion effects interrupt psychic abilities
- **Mental Mirror**: Reflects mental attacks back at source
- **High Mental Armor**: Build Willpower for better defense
- **Anchoring**: Some items and abilities prevent forced teleportation

## Original Description (For Reference)

A performance optimization mod that prevents NPCs from using the Spacetime Vortex ability while allowing the player to continue using it.

### Why This Mod?

- **Performance**: When multiple NPCs use Spacetime Vortex, it can cause significant lag
- **Player Advantage Maintained**: You can still use Spacetime Vortex normally
- **Cleaner Combat**: Reduces the chaos and performance hit from NPC Spacetime Vortex activations

### What It Does

- Blocks all NPCs and enemies from activating Spacetime Vortex
- Player character can still use Spacetime Vortex without restrictions
- No impact on other abilities or game mechanics
